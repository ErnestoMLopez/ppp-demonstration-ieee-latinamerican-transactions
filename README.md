# Scripts for IEEE Latinamerica Transactions: "Low-Cost Satellite-Based Correction Service for Precise Point Positioning in Latin America"

The data processing was implemented in Matlab. The main script is "main_IEEELatam.m". 

The program uses additional libreries for data handling and processing. They are located in the ModulosGNSS folder. 
The user should follow the instructions in its readme in order to be able to use the entire script and download automatically the files needed for the processing, including the observables and the GNSS products.
